Predicting New York AIrbnb prices

The goal of this project is to try and predict the prices of Airbnbs based on various factors such as location, availability, the number of people and duration of the stay. 
We are using the dataset provided by Airbnb for the previous year. The data consists of details such as the address, neighborhood details, price for a night, number of reviews, availability throughout the year and room type.
To achieve this goal, we will be processing and cleaning the data and applying regression analysis to determine the price of Airbnb based on the user entered attributes.

Steps:
- Preprocess Airbnb listings data, including information such as property type, location, amenities, and host characteristics for New York City.
- Conduct extensive data analysis and use decision trees to identify the most important features in the dataset.
- Based on the results of the EDA and feature engineering, compare regression models to predict Airbnb prices.
